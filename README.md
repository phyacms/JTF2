# Welcome to JTF2, Agent!

[JTF2](https://github.com/phyacms/JTF2) is an macro application
made for [Tom Clancy's DivisionÂ® 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-division/the-division-2) agents,
based on [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script language.
JTF2 is an abbreviation of "Joint-Trouble-Free for TD2". JTF2 will spare agents' finger joints by providing some useful macros.

This application provides:
- Auto-clicking in two modes: press mode and repeat mode.
- Alternative keyboard key that mimics clicking.
- Auto-opening inventory/apparel caches.
- Convenient way to turn on/off summit matchmaking in legend difficulty.

Almost all of the macros included are gathered from various public TD2 communities,
such like [dcinside TD2 minor gallery](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists/?id=td2), for example.
This program is nothing just more than a collection of already well-known macros, so if you wish to,
please give the credits to devoting fellow agents who actually developed and brought them to us. Many thanks!
